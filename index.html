        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ§ </div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My professional experiences are situated within barista-based careers. My first long-term job was at a local bubble tea shop where I found enjoyment in creating and making drinks, as well as serving customers. The privilege to be part of the process in producing refreshments meant to fulfill a customerâ€™s needs both in terms of taste and presentation was a challenging and exciting experience. It helps that many of their reactions to the final product are a telltale sign of your performance, which can also be both a source of growth and personal reward. I have since continued to a franchise-based bubble tea store in which my experience in the work field has broadened to accommodate the demands of a faster-paced environment as well as corporate-based regulations. Not only is it a drastic change, it is a positive one in which I can expand my practice to a standard applicable to careers such as those of a consumer psychologist. While done passively, itâ€™s part of a baristaâ€™s job to sell the product through effective dialogue- for example: affirmations, suggestions, and positive associations. Many see jobs where the cashier role is involved to be just that; sell a product to the customer. In reality we are depended on to maximize the chance of an exchange occurring. <br><br>

        In this process of drink making, customer interactions, and upkeep with the dynamics of a chain-based company, I am confident that my time in the field has warranted enough recognition of customer motivations and influences that are catalyst in how they communicate with products and environments in a retail setting, and in effective response, yielding higher rates of engagement in the moment and the future. 
<br><br>

        My experience is not limited to in-person commerce- I have also sustained an online business before beginning official work experience during high school. It began while scrolling through Instagram one day and after becoming intrigued with a product that was beginning to grow in the world of video upload, which had just been introduced to the platform around that time period. Eventually I began producing my own videos with said product, and with time, I saw my account grow into a business. The best part of this particular experience was the adaptations I had to make according to the constantly changing algorithm, as well as comparing performance for each video with competitors while maintaining relationships at the same time, and being able to manage an account in which I could sell the product through a different platform. Iâ€™m proud to say many of these came instinctively, considering the time and money that had been put into the project in the first place it was important to make a return over that amount. With the right priorities in mind, I could keep the business alive until I transferred to university, and continue to do so without the selling aspect. It has since become a hobby that I enjoy from time to time. Looking back, it is one of my most fond memories that fall into multiple categories.
